## Homework Collection: Market Microstructure Models
MTH9879 Market Microstructure Models is a graduate course for students of Baruch MFE Program. All homeworks is done in Jupyter Notebook with R.

The course covers but not limits to the folowing topics:

 - Market mechanisms
 - Theoretical and empirical models of the order book
 - The market/limit order decision
 - Inventory models
 - Rational expectations and models of strategic trading
 - Market making
 - Sequential trade models
 - Understanding the bid-ask spread
 - Variance and covariance estimation
 - The long memory of order flow
 - Models of market impact
 - Market impact of meta-orders
 - Price manipulation
 - Optimal execution strategies
 - Modeling latency
 - Optimal order routing algorithms
 
 
 
 ### Lecture 1: Market mechanisms and zero intelligence models of the order book
 
 - The limit order book can be viewed as a complex queuing system.
 - Even with very simple rules, complex order flow and price dynamics can be generated.
 - With more realistic rules, zero-intelligence models of the order book can serve as useful tools for comparing the performance of proposed order execution strategies.

 ### Lecture 2: Order book and order flow: The market or limit order decision
 
 - Parlour (1998) shows that a rational market order/ limit order decision should depend on the state of the order book
 - Foucault, Kadan and Kandel (2005) model the order book as a market for immediacy, relating the spread to the ratio between patient and impatient traders
 - Rosu (2009) removes many over-stylized features of FKK (2005) by allowing instantaneous cancelation of orders
 - Cont and Kukanov (2013) show how to incorporate the fee structures and current queue lengths in different venues to optimize the market/limit order mix.
 - Bouchaud, Mezard and Potters show that the average order book shape, consistent with ZI simulation and empirical observation, may be derived using a simple price diffusion approximation
Mike and Farmer find a simple empirical relationship between the arrival rates of limit and market orders
